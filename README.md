# Javascript Scope and Closure

With some basic JavaScript principles in hand, we can now expand our skills out even further by exploring Scope and Closure.  Finish each task in order as the concepts build on one another.

## Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

* [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
* [ ] Add your group lead/instructor as collaborator on Github.
* [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Gabi's by mistake!).
* [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
* [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

**Follow these steps for completing your project.**

* [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into main (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
* [ ] Add your group lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
* [ ] Your group lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into main.

## Task 2: Scope and Closure

This task focuses on getting practice with scope and closures by asking you to write your own closure functions.

* [ ] Review the contents of the [scope_closure.js](scope_closure.js) file.
* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Go back through the stretch problems that you skipped over and complete as many as you can.
